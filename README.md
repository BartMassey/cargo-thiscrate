# cargo-thiscrate: display Rust library crate name
Bart Massey 2022

This program prints the "true name" of a Rust library
crate. This is useful in tooling. The code is not tested, so
*caveat emptor*.

# Acknowledgments

Thanks to @kornelski on Github, whose `cargo_toml` crate
made making this straightforward.
